# Contributing
As an open-source project, anyone is welome to contribute to this project. At the same time, some contributing standards are expected.

## Branch Naming Convention
As this project is using [a Waffle scrumb board](https://waffle.io/chingu-voyage5/Bears-Team-3), branches follow a specific naming convention for [automation purposes](https://help.waffle.io/faq/waffle-workflow/is-there-any-way-to-move-an-issue-in-progress-without-manually-drag-and-dropping-it-on-my-waffle-board).

Branch names must start with the issue number that it fixes or closes. The number should be followed by a dash, `-`, with a short description written in [`kebab-case`](http://wiki.c2.com/?KebabCase).

For example, assume an issue number 123 that is for a bug in the user form. A good branch name would be: `123-fix-user-form-bug`.

## Commit Message Convention
This project follows the [seven rules of a great Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules) (a great article on commit message altogether). These are:

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

## Pull Requests
For a pull request to be accepted, it must be fully linted, all tests must pass and one thorough [code review](#code-reviews) must be done.

### Code Reviews
Code reviews are undoubtedly the most sensitive part of any pull request. With this in mind, rudeness, sarcasm or any kind of toxic behavior will not be tolerated. For a good idea of how to be respectful during the code review stage, please read: ["Unlearning toxic behaviors in a code review culture"](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/unlearning-toxic-behaviors-in-a-code-review-culture-b7c295452a3c).
